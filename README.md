# Prelude

In 2020, the HCoV-2 pandemic spread across the globe, and the internet became more important than ever before. Being online is now equivalent to being alive. As a result, DOGS, the Department of Government Security, was created in Britain, allegedly to protect internet users from digital fraud and cyberattacks. However, in reality, it has become a tool for persecution and censorship worldwide as it power grew. Something has to be done about it.
<br>

# Beginning

As the pandemic raged on, the virus became even more contagious and, alarmingly, more deadly. Entire blocks were turned into quarantine zones, with towering walls and checkpoints. HCoV-2 had evolved and become more stable and resistant, maintaining its virulence and ability to spread, allowing it to survive on surfaces and in the air for longer periods of time. Only authorized personnel were allowed to enter the streets in order to maintain internet infrastructure.<br>As society was locked up in their homes,  The Department of Government Security, which now  spanned across Europe, gained significant influence and started to act bolder. Network unrest grew, and the boiling point was reached when the Tor project was exposed for its collaboration with the government and military. In response to this, a child of rebellion and frustration against censorship, a chip, later named "Blackwall," was created. This chip allowed devices to connect to the decentralized network which was formed by other chips.<br>
The Subnet was born.
