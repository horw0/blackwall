# Blackwall

Survival game in cold world of epidemical apocalyplse and cyberwars.

# Lore
## Prelude
In 2020, the HCoV-2 pandemic spread across the globe, and the Internet became more important than ever before. Being online was equivalent to being alive. As a result, DOGS, the Department of Government Security, was created in Britain, allegedly to protect internet users from digital fraud and cyberattacks in this dire time. However, in reality, it has become a tool for persecution and censorship worldwide as it power grew. Something has to be done about it.

## Second outbreak
Two years later, as the pandemic raged on and on, the virus became even more contagious and, alarmingly, more deadly. People, as well as infected, grew more irritant and violent. Entire blocks were turned into quarantine zones, with towering walls and checkpoints. HCoV-2 had evolved and become more stable and resistant, maintaining its virulence and ability to spread, allowing it to survive on surfaces and in the air for longer periods of time. Only authorized personnel were allowed to enter the streets in order to maintain the infrastructure.

As society was locked up in their homes, The Department of Government Security, which now spanned across Europe, gained significant influence and started to act bolder. Social unrest in the Net was growing, and the boiling point was reached when the Tor project was exposed for its collaboration with the government and military.

In response to this, a child of rebellion and frustration, a chip, later named "Blackwall" was created. This chip allowed devices to connect to the decentralized network which was formed by other chips.<br>

The Wild West of the Internet, the Subnet, was born.

## Division
As this island of digital freedom, carved out by the enthusiasts, was growing and gaining popularity, at some point it got noticed by the DOGS. In the blink of the eye the Subnet was claimed a "safe haven for terrorists and extremists", and anyone involved in the production or distribution of "Blackwall" chips was persecuted for "undermining activity against society and government".

Subnet original creators, named by the community as "Founders", tried to fight the accusations and explain their stance, but state-bred media doubled down on them, per request from DOGS. The message was clear.

With the help of Subnet activists from the military, the Founders got their hands on the "Horizon" encryption gateway blueprints. Combined with "Blackwall" chip, this gateway became a foundation and an entry point for deeper levels of Subnet. Digital trenches were ready. Silent war against DOGS and everyone affiliated was declared.
